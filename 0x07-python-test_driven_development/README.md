# 0x07-python-test_driven_development

## Overview

Welcome to the 0x07-python-test_driven_development repository! This collection of Python scripts and programs is dedicated to Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. Each script is designed to demonstrate and practice TDD, emphasizing the creation of tests before writing the actual code.

## List of Scripts

1. **0-add_integer.py**
   - Implements a function that adds two integers.

2. **1-divisible_by_2.py**
   - Defines a function to check if a number is divisible by 2.

3. **2-matrix_divided.py**
   - Implements a function to divide all elements of a matrix.

4. **3-say_my_name.py**
   - Creates a function that prints a person's name.

5. **4-print_square.py**
   - Implements a function to print a square with a specified size.

6. **5-text_indentation.py**
   - Defines a function to add two new lines after each period, question mark, and exclamation mark in a given text.

## List of Tests

1. **tests/0-add_integer.txt**
   - Contains test cases for the `0-add_integer.py` script.

2. **tests/1-divisible_by_2.txt**
   - Provides test cases for the `1-divisible_by_2.py` script.

3. **tests/2-matrix_divided.txt**
   - Presents test cases for the `2-matrix_divided.py` script.

4. **tests/3-say_my_name.txt**
   - Includes test cases for the `3-say_my_name.py` script.

5. **tests/4-print_square.txt**
   - Offers test cases for the `4-print_square.py` script.

6. **tests/5-text_indentation.txt**
   - Contains test cases for the `5-text_indentation.py` script.

## How to Use

Each script is associated with a set of test cases in the `tests` directory. To run the tests, use the following command in your terminal:
