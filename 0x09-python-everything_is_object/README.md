# 0x09-python-everything_is_object

This repository contains solutions for the "0x09. Python - Everything is Object" projects at Holberton School. The projects focus on understanding the concept of objects in Python, object mutability, and the difference between mutable and immutable types.

## Projects

### 0. Readme

This project serves as the main README file for the repository, providing an overview of the contents and a guide on how to navigate and use the code.

### 1. Who am I?

In this project, the task is to write a Python script that prints the variable type and the value of a variable.

### 2. What is my ID?

The objective of this project is to write a Python script that prints the variable type and the value of an object's identifier (ID).

### 3. Integers

For this project, the goal is to answer multiple-choice questions about integers and their representation in Python.

### 4. Floats

In this project, the task is to answer multiple-choice questions about floats and their representation in Python.

### 5. Strings

The objective of this project is to answer multiple-choice questions about strings and their representation in Python.

### 6. Lists

For this project, the goal is to answer multiple-choice questions about lists and their representation in Python.

### 7. Tuple or not?

In this project, the task is to determine whether a given object is a tuple or not.

### 8. Tuple or not tuple

The objective of this project is to determine whether a given object is an instance of the specified class or inherited from it.

### 9. More than one element

For this project, the goal is to find the index of the first occurrence of an element in a list.

### 10. Slice me up

In this project, the task is to create a new sentence by slicing and concatenating parts of an existing sentence.

### 11. Assign a value to a variable

The objective of this project is to assign a new value to a variable and observe the changes in the original list.

### 12. Immutable object

For this project, the goal is to modify the value of a tuple, demonstrating the immutability of tuples.

### 13. Delete by value

In this project, the task is to remove all occurrences of a specific value in a list.

### 14. CPython #0: Python strings

The objective of this project is to answer multiple-choice questions about CPython and string interning.

### 15. CPython #1: PyBytesObject

For this project, the goal is to answer multiple-choice questions about CPython and PyBytesObject.

## How to Use

Each project folder contains the Python files necessary to run the scripts or answer the questions. To execute a script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/amandamadlingozi/0x09-python-everything_is_object.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the specific project folder:

    ```bash
    cd 0x09-python-everything_is_object/project-folder
    ```

3. Run the script with Python:

    ```bash
    python script.py
    ```

Make sure to replace `script.py` with the appropriate script file for each project.
