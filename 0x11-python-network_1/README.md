    git clone https://github.com/amandamadlingozi/0x11-python-network_1.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the specific project folder:

    ```bash
    cd 0x11-python-network_1/project-folder
    ```

3. Run the script with Python:

    ```bash
    python script.py
    ```

Make sure to replace `script.py` with the appropriate script file for each project.
