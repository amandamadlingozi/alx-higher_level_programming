# 0x13-javascript_objects_scopes_closures

This repository contains solutions for the "0x13. Javascript - Objects, Scopes, Closures" projects at Holberton School. The projects focus on understanding and working with JavaScript objects, scopes, and closures.

## Projects

### 0. Readme

This project serves as the main README file for the repository, providing an overview of the contents and a guide on how to navigate and use the code.

### 1. Rectangle

In this project, the task is to define a class `Rectangle` in JavaScript that represents a rectangle. The class includes methods to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.

### 2. Rectangle #2

Building on the previous project, this project introduces additional features to the `Rectangle` class, including width and height validation and printing the rectangle using the `print` method.

### 3. Square

For this project, the goal is to define a class `Square` in JavaScript that inherits from the `Rectangle` class. The `Square` class includes its own constructor and overrides the `print` method.

### 4. Inheritance

In this project, the task is to define a class `Square` that inherits from the `Square` class created in the previous project. Additional methods and properties are added to the `Square` class.

### 5. Log me

The objective of this project is to create a function `logMe` in JavaScript that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value each time it is called.

## How to Use

Each project folder contains the JavaScript files necessary to run the scripts or check the implementation. To test the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/amandamadlingozi/0x13-javascript_objects_scopes_closures.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the specific project folder:

    ```bash
    cd 0x13-javascript_objects_scopes_closures/project-folder
    ```

3. Run the script with Node.js:

    ```bash
    node script.js [arguments]
    ```

Make sure to replace `[arguments]` with the appropriate values required by each script.

## Requirements

- Node.js installed
