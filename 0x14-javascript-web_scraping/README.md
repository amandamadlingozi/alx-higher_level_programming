# 0x14-javascript-web_scraping

This repository contains solutions for the "0x14. Javascript - Web Scraping" projects at Holberton School. The projects focus on using JavaScript to perform web scraping tasks and gather information from websites.

## Projects

### 1. Write me

In this project, the goal is to write a script in JavaScript that reads and prints the content of a file. The script takes a filename as a command-line argument and prints the content of the file to the standard output.

### 2. Status code

The objective of this project is to write a script in JavaScript that displays the status code of a GET request to a specified URL. The script takes the URL as a command-line argument and prints the status code.

### 3. Star wars

For this project, the task is to write a script in JavaScript that fetches and prints the title of a Star Wars movie using the Star Wars API (SWAPI). The script takes an episode number as a command-line argument and makes a GET request to the SWAPI to retrieve information about the corresponding movie.

### 4. Star wars Wedge Antilles

Building on the previous project, the goal here is to write a script that fetches and prints the character Wedge Antilles from the Star Wars API. The script takes the character's name as a command-line argument and retrieves information about the character from the SWAPI.

### 5. request

In this project, the task is to write a script in JavaScript that fetches and prints the contents of a webpage. The script takes a URL as a command-line argument and uses the `request` module to make a GET request and print the content of the page.

## How to Use

Each project folder contains the JavaScript files necessary to run the scripts. To execute a script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/amandamadlingozi/0x14-javascript-web_scraping.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the specific project folder:

    ```bash
    cd 0x14-javascript-web_scraping/project-folder
    ```

3. Run the script with Node.js:

    ```bash
    node script.js [arguments]
    ```

Make sure to replace `[arguments]` with the appropriate values required by each script.
